## 1. Introduction to CI-CD

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**. It's a methodology that aims to streamline and accelerate the software development lifecycle through automation, enabling teams to deliver code changes more frequently and reliably.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Developer Code] --> B[Version Control]
    B --> C[CI: Build & Test]
    C --> D[CD: Deploy to Staging]
    D --> E[CD: Deploy to Production]
    E --> F[Monitor & Feedback]
    F --> A
```

### The Evolution of Software Delivery

| Era | Approach | Release Cycle | Key Characteristics |
|-----|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Traditional** | Manual deployments | Months/Years | High risk, slow feedback |
| **Agile** | Sprint-based releases | Weeks | Improved collaboration |
| **DevOps** | Automated pipelines | Days/Hours | Fast feedback, reliable |
| **Modern CI/CD** | Continuous deployment | Minutes | Automated everything |

### Core Benefits of CI/CD

1. **🚀 Faster Time to Market**: Automated pipelines reduce deployment time from days to minutes
2. **🐛 Early Bug Detection**: Issues are caught within hours, not weeks
3. **💰 Cost Reduction**: Fixing bugs early is 100x cheaper than in production
4. **👥 Improved Collaboration**: Breaks down silos between Dev and Ops teams
5. **📊 Better Quality**: Automated testing ensures consistent quality standards
6. **🔄 Rapid Feedback**: Get user feedback quickly and iterate faster

## 2. Understanding CI vs CD

### Continuous Integration (CI)

**Continuous Integration** is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated builds and tests.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Continuous Integration Flow"
        A[Developer writes code] --> B[Commit to feature branch]
        B --> C[Create merge request]
        C --> D[Automated tests run]
        D --> E{Tests pass?}
        E -->|Yes| F[Merge to main branch]
        E -->|No| G[Fix issues]
        G --> B
        F --> H[Build artifact]
    end
```

#### Key CI Principles

- **Frequent commits**: Developers integrate code at least daily
- **Automated testing**: Every commit triggers automated tests
- **Fast feedback**: Issues are identified within minutes
- **Shared repository**: Single source of truth for all code

### Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Continuous Delivery"
        A1[CI Complete] --> B1[Deploy to Staging]
        B1 --> C1[Automated Tests]
        C1 --> D1[Manual Approval]
        D1 --> E1[Deploy to Production]
    end
    
    subgraph "Continuous Deployment"
        A2[CI Complete] --> B2[Deploy to Staging]
        B2 --> C2[Automated Tests]
        C2 --> D2[Automatic Deploy to Production]
    end
```

| Aspect | Continuous Delivery | Continuous Deployment |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Automation Level** | Automated until production | Fully automated |
| **Human Intervention** | Required for production release | No manual gates |
| **Risk Level** | Lower (human verification) | Higher (requires robust testing) |
| **Release Frequency** | On-demand | Every successful build |
| **Best For** | Most organizations | Mature DevOps teams |

### The CI/CD Pipeline Stages

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Complete CI/CD Pipeline"
        A[Source Code] --> B[Build]
        B --> C[Unit Tests]
        C --> D[Integration Tests]
        D --> E[Security Scans]
        E --> F[Package]
        F --> G[Deploy to Dev]
        G --> H[Smoke Tests]
        H --> I[Deploy to Staging]
        I --> J[Performance Tests]
        J --> K[User Acceptance Tests]
        K --> L{Approval needed?}
        L -->|CD: Yes| M[Manual Approval]
        L -->|CD: No| N[Deploy to Production]
        M --> N
        N --> O[Monitor]
    end
```

```

### Key Automation Areas

#### 1. **Build Automation**

- Compiles source code into executable artifacts
- Manages dependencies
- Creates container images
- Generates documentation

#### 2. **Test Automation**

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure scalability
- **Security Tests**: Identify vulnerabilities

#### 3. **Deployment Automation**

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Switch between two identical environments
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout to subset of users
- **Rolling Updates**: Update instances one at a time
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle features without deployment

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

IaC treats infrastructure configuration as software code, enabling version control, testing, and automation.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Traditional Infrastructure"
        A1[Manual Setup] --> B1[Documentation]
        B1 --> C1[Configuration Drift]
        C1 --> D1[Inconsistencies]
    end
    
    subgraph "Infrastructure as Code"
        A2[Code Repository] --> B2[Version Control]
        B2 --> C2[Automated Provisioning]
        C2 --> D2[Consistent Environments]
    end
```

**Popular IaC Tools:**

- **Terraform**: Multi-cloud provisioning
- **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS-specific

## 7. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Understanding IaC

Infrastructure as Code is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual hardware configuration.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "IaC Workflow"
        A[Define Infrastructure] --> B[Version Control]
        B --> C[Review Changes]
        C --> D[Apply Changes]
        D --> E[Infrastructure Created]
        E --> F[Monitor & Iterate]
        F --> A
    end
```

### IaC Principles

1. **Declarative vs Imperative**
   - **Declarative**: Describe desired state
   - **Imperative**: Describe steps to achieve state

2. **Idempotency**
   - Same result regardless of how many times applied
   - Prevents configuration drift

3. **Version Control**
   - Track all infrastructure changes
   - Enable rollbacks and auditing

### IaC in CI/CD Pipelines

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "IaC Integration"
        A[Code Commit] --> B[CI Pipeline]
        B --> C[Validate IaC]
        C --> D[Plan Changes]
        D --> E[Review Plan]
        E --> F[Apply IaC]
        F --> G[Deploy Application]
        G --> H[Verify Infrastructure]
    end
```

### Example: Terraform in CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions with Terraform
terraform:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
    
    - name: Terraform Init
      run: terraform init
      
    - name: Terraform Plan
      run: terraform plan -out=tfplan
      
    - name: Terraform Apply
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan
```

### IaC Best Practices

| Practice | Description | Benefit |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Modular Design** | Break infrastructure into reusable modules | Maintainability |
| **State Management** | Centralize state files | Collaboration |
| **Policy as Code** | Enforce compliance rules | Security |
| **Testing** | Test infrastructure code | Reliability |
| **Documentation** | Document infrastructure decisions | Knowledge sharing |

## 8. Reusable Pipelines & Central Pipeline Methods

### The Challenge of Pipeline Sprawl

As organizations grow, they often face "pipeline sprawl" - hundreds of repositories with similar but slightly different CI/CD configurations. This leads to:

- **Duplicated code** across pipelines
- **Inconsistent practices** between teams
- **Maintenance nightmares** when updating common patterns
- **Security vulnerabilities** from outdated configurations

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Without Reusable Pipelines"
        A1[Repo 1 Pipeline] --> D1[Duplicate Code]
        A2[Repo 2 Pipeline] --> D2[Duplicate Code]
        A3[Repo 3 Pipeline] --> D3[Duplicate Code]
        D1 & D2 & D3 --> P1[Maintenance Issues]
    end
    
    subgraph "With Reusable Pipelines"
        C[Central Pipeline] --> R1[Repo 1]
        C --> R2[Repo 2]
        C --> R3[Repo 3]
        C --> U[Update Once, Apply Everywhere]
    end
```

### GitHub Actions: Reusable Workflows

#### 1. **Creating Reusable Workflows**

Reusable workflows allow you to define a workflow once and call it from multiple repositories.

**Central Workflow** (`.github/workflows/reusable-build.yml`):

```yaml
name: Reusable Build Workflow

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      node-version:
        required: false
        type: string
        default: '18'
      environment:
        required: true
        type: string
    secrets:
      NPM_TOKEN:
        required: true
      DEPLOY_KEY:
        required: false

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ inputs.node-version }}
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build
      
      - name: Upload artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
          path: dist/
  
  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: inputs.environment != 'development'
    steps:
      - name: Download artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: build-artifacts
      
      - name: Deploy to ${{ inputs.environment }}
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to ${{ inputs.environment }}"
          # Actual deployment logic here
        env:
          DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

**Calling Workflow** (in each repository):

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  development:
    uses: my-org/central-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-build.yml@v1
    with:
      environment: development
    secrets:
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
  
  production:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    uses: my-org/central-workflows/.github/workflows/reusable-build.yml@v1
    with:
      environment: production
      node-version: '20'
    secrets:
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
      DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.PROD_DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

#### 2. **Composite Actions**

For smaller reusable units, create composite actions:

**action.yml** (in `.github/actions/security-scan`):

```yaml
name: 'Security Scan'
description: 'Run security scans on the codebase'
inputs:
  scan-type:
    description: 'Type of security scan'
    required: false
    default: 'all'

runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    - name: Run dependency check
      shell: bash
      run: |
        npm audit
        
    - name: Run SAST scan
      uses: github/super-linter@v4
      env:
        DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
    
    - name: Run secret scanning
      shell: bash
      run: |
        npx secretlint "**/*"
```

#### 3. **Organization-Level Workflows**

Create workflows that automatically run across all repositories in your organization:

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/org-security-scan.yml in your .github repository
name: Organization Security Scan

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Run organization-wide security audit
        uses: my-org/security-actions/audit@v1
```

### GitLab CI/CD: Components and Templates

#### 1. **CI/CD Components**

GitLab's CI/CD components are reusable pipeline configuration units:

**Component Definition** (`templates/security/sast.yml`):

```yaml
spec:
  inputs:
    stage:
      default: test
    scanner:
      default: semgrep
    rules:
      default: auto

---
"$[[ inputs.scanner ]]-sast":
  stage: $[[ inputs.stage ]]
  image: returntocorp/semgrep:latest
  script:
    - semgrep --config=$[[ inputs.rules ]] --json --output=sast-report.json .
  artifacts:
    reports:
      sast: sast-report.json
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

**Using the Component**:

```yaml
include:
  - component: gitlab.com/my-org/ci-components/security/sast@v1
    inputs:
      stage: security-test
      scanner: semgrep
      rules: "p/security-audit"

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - security-test
  - deploy
```

#### 2. **Template Repositories**

Create a central repository with pipeline templates:

**Central Template** (`gitlab-ci-templates/node-app.yml`):

```yaml
variables:
  NODE_VERSION: "18"
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2

.node-base:
  image: node:${NODE_VERSION}
  cache:
    key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
    paths:
      - node_modules/
      - .npm/

.build-template:
  extends: .node-base
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 1 week

.test-template:
  extends: .node-base
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm ci --cache .npm --prefer-offline
    - npm run test:ci
  coverage: '/Coverage: \d+\.\d+%/'

.deploy-template:
  stage: deploy
  image: alpine:latest
  before_script:
    - apk add --no-cache curl
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to ${CI_ENVIRONMENT_NAME}"
    - curl -X POST ${DEPLOY_WEBHOOK_URL}
```

**Project Pipeline** (using templates):

```yaml
include:
  - project: 'my-org/gitlab-ci-templates'
    ref: main
    file: '/node-app.yml'

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:app:
  extends: .build-template
  variables:
    NODE_VERSION: "20"  # Override default

test:unit:
  extends: .test-template
  dependencies:
    - build:app

deploy:staging:
  extends: .deploy-template
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.example.com
  only:
    - develop
```

#### 3. **Include and Extends**

Use multiple inclusion strategies:

```yaml
# Include multiple sources
include:
  # Local file
  - local: '.gitlab/ci/build.yml'
  
  # Template from GitLab
  - template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml
  
  # File from another project
  - project: 'my-org/ci-templates'
    ref: v2.0
    file: '/templates/deploy.yml'
  
  # Remote URL
  - remote: 'https://example.com/ci-templates/test.yml'

# Extend and override
.base-deploy:
  script:
    - echo "Base deployment"
  only:
    - main

deploy-prod:
  extends: .base-deploy
  script:
    - echo "Override base"
    - !reference [.base-deploy, script]  # Include base script
    - echo "Additional production steps"
```

### Comparison: Reusability Features

| Feature | GitHub Actions | GitLab CI/CD |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Reusable Units** | Workflows, Composite Actions | Components, Templates |
| **Sharing Mechanism** | GitHub Marketplace, Org repos | CI/CD Catalog, Include |
| **Parameterization** | Inputs and Secrets | Inputs and Variables |
| **Version Control** | Git tags/branches | Git tags/branches |
| **Discovery** | Marketplace search | CI/CD Catalog |
| **Access Control** | Repository permissions | Project permissions |
| **Testing** | Action testing frameworks | Pipeline testing |

### Best Practices for Reusable Pipelines

#### 1. **Design Principles**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Reusable Pipeline Design"
        A[Single Responsibility] --> B[Each component does one thing well]
        C[Parameterization] --> D[Flexible through inputs]
        E[Versioning] --> F[Semantic versioning for stability]
        G[Documentation] --> H[Clear usage examples]
        I[Testing] --> J[Test reusable components]
    end
```

#### 2. **Organization Structure**

```
central-ci/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       ├── build-node.yml
│       ├── build-python.yml
│       ├── security-scan.yml
│       └── deploy-k8s.yml
├── components/
│   ├── security/
│   ├── quality/
│   └── deployment/
├── docs/
│   └── usage-guide.md
└── examples/
    └── implementation-samples/
```

#### 3. **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Start with Common Patterns**
   - Identify repeated code across pipelines
   - Extract common build/test/deploy steps
   - Create simple reusable components

2. **Gradual Migration**

   ```mermaid
   graph LR
       A[Identify Patterns] --> B[Create Templates]
       B --> C[Test with Pilot Team]
       C --> D[Refine Based on Feedback]
       D --> E[Roll Out Organization-wide]
       E --> F[Continuous Improvement]
   ```

3. **Governance Model**
   - Central team maintains core components
   - Teams can contribute improvements
   - Version control for stability
   - Regular reviews and updates

#### 4. **Security Considerations**

- **Secret Management**: Never hardcode secrets in reusable workflows
- **Access Control**: Limit who can modify central pipelines
- **Audit Trail**: Track usage and changes
- **Compliance**: Ensure reusable components meet security standards

### Real-World Example: Enterprise Pipeline

```yaml
# Central Security-First Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
name: Enterprise Standard Pipeline

on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      app-type:
        type: string
        required: true
      deploy-env:
        type: string
        required: true

jobs:
  compliance-check:
    uses: enterprise/workflows/.github/workflows/compliance.yml@v2
    
  security-scan:
    uses: enterprise/workflows/.github/workflows/security.yml@v2
    with:
      scan-level: ${{ inputs.app-type == 'financial' && 'high' || 'standard' }}
  
  build-and-test:
    needs: [compliance-check]
    uses: enterprise/workflows/.github/workflows/${{ inputs.app-type }}-build.yml@v2
  
  deploy:
    needs: [security-scan, build-and-test]
    uses: enterprise/workflows/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@v2
    with:
      environment: ${{ inputs.deploy-env }}
      approval-required: ${{ inputs.deploy-env == 'production' }}
```

This approach ensures:

- ✅ Consistent security scanning across all apps
- ✅ Compliance checks before any builds
- ✅ Standardized deployment process
- ✅ Easy updates to security policies
- ✅ Reduced maintenance overhead

## 9. Best Practices & Implementation
